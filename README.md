# -Python-Turtle-Animation-Circle-Rotation-
"Python Turtle Animation: Circle Rotation" uses turtle to create a rotating line animation. Function moves turtle forward &amp; turns right for 360 iterations. Code available on GitHub for customization.
# -Python Turtle Animation: Circle Rotation
"Python Turtle Animation: Circle Rotation" is a Python program that creates an animation of a line rotating in a circle using the turtle library. The program defines a function that moves the turtle forward and turns it right for 360 iterations, creating the rotating effect. This animation can be customized with additional elements to create more complex and visually appealing animations using the turtle library.

# -Usage
To run "Python Turtle Animation: Circle Rotation," simply download the circle_rotation.py file from the GitHub repository and run it in a Python environment. The animation will open in a window and continue until the user closes the window.

# -Customization
To customize the animation, you can modify the animate() function in the circle_rotation.py file. You can change the color and size of the line, add additional shapes or elements to the animation, or modify the number of iterations to change the speed or duration of the animation.

# -Credits
"Python Turtle Animation: Circle Rotation" was inspired by similar animations and programming tutorials online. Special thanks to the developers of Python and the turtle library for making this project possible.
